# PyATMM

### About

PyATMM is an implementation of the Generalized Transfer Matrix Method - a matrix method for calcualting the reflectivities and transmittances of layered systems consisting of isotropic and anisotropic dielectric materials. If only working with isotropic materials, [PyTMM](https://kitchenknif.github.io/PyTMM) may by simpler to use.

### Features
Currently supports

* Isotropic materials
* Uniaxial materials

### References
This implementation is based on the following papers:
