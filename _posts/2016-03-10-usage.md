The PyATMM module is separated into three submodules:
* transferMatrix
* isotropicTransferMatrix
* uniaxialTransferMatrix

### transferMatrix
transferMatrix contains general functions related to the generalized transfer matrix method. Most of them are currently either non-functional or unused. The main function in this submodule is

    solve_transfer_matrix(M)

Which takes a transfer matrix **M** and returns 8 reflectivity/transmittance coefficients -

    r_ss, r_sp, r_ps, r_pp, t_ss, t_sp, t_ps, t_pp

Where **r** or **t** represent either reflectivity or transmittance and **s** / **p** signify the polarization of the initial (first) and transmitted/reflected (second) mode. E.g.

    r_sp

Is the reflectivity coefficient where the incident wave was  **s** polarized and the reflected wave is **p** polarized.

The **s** and **p** polarization designations are somewhat arbitrary in the current implementation - depending on how the incident wave is specified, they are not necessarily the **TM** and **TE** polarizations (for isotropic materials).

### isotropicTransferMatrix
isotropicTransferMatrix contains functions related to building transfer matrices for isotropic materials:

* 	```build_isotropic_dynamic_matrix(eps, w, kx, ky)```
*   ```build_isotropic_propagation_matrix(eps, w, kx, ky, d)```


### uniaxialTransferMatrix

*	```build_uniaxial_dynamic_matrix(e_o, e_e, w, kx, ky, opticAxis=([0., 1., 0.]))```
* 	```build_uniaxial_propagation_matrix(e_o, e_e, w, kx, ky, d, opticAxis=([0., 1., 0.]))```
